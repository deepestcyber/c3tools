Run

    make find_free_words

to get a list of words that are still available.

To just get the free numbers and all their readable names
(not necessarily words), simply run

    make free_numbers

and read the `free_numbers` file.

Note that the event is still hard-coded in the `Makefile`
so to fetch the appropriate phonebook you need to change it there.
